Currency Comparison Tool
================

This demo web app was written using Rails 5, Haml, [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/), and [Foundation 6](http://foundation.zurb.com/index.html).

I considered Highcharts' rendering and graphing to be outside the scope of the application's test suite.

This application uses Sass. While I did not have need for it here, I generally adhere to the [SMACSS Architecture](https://smacss.com/) for how I approach my CSS code.
